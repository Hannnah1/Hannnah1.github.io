# Hi there.

I'm a current graduate student, and security researcher of sorts. I am also interested in privacy and anonymity technology, human computer interaction, and the perpetually evolving relationship between technology and society.

# Research
Currently exploring threats to modern HPC systems and  their potential impact on data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.  
Broadly, my research interests also include
- Low latency anonymity netwokrs (mainly Tor)
- Trends in cybercrime
- User Experience and its impact on adoption of various technologies
